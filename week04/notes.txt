Chapter 8: Forms:

You can 'process' a form on the front-end using Javascript and input values.

Gets the first form from the page (JS):
const form = document.forms[0];
const form = document.forms['form-name'];

form.submit() will submit the form but not trigger the submit event.

Focus, blur, change, and submit are the most important form events, submit is number 1.

type="password" will make the characters be concealed.

Checkboxes can be checked with .checked = true.
