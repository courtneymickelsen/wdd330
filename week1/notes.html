    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Reading:</h2>
    <p>
        Computers/applications aren't going to remember anything by themselves. You have to tell them.
        <br>
        <br>IO = Input/Output
        <br>
        <br>Section takes up the whole width of the page by default.
        <br>
        <br>You can use 'localStorage' and it doesn't have to be created by you... kind of like 'document'.
        <br>It also has functions that come with it, such as 'getItem' and 'setItem'... a bit like document's getElementById or querySelector functions.
        <br>When using setItem, you have to pass in a key/value pair. This will be like in python when you add an item to a dictionary. 
        <br>You can access the value by using the key to find it.
        <br>
        <br>When using input or textarea, use '.value', when using section, use '.innerHTML'.
        <br>
        <br>Questions- 
        <br>- It says the header tags only go through h4... Is that true? I thought it was h6.
        <br>- They didn't use labels for their input... but I did. It think it's better that way?

        Design for the smallest and least powerful device (that your software will be viewed on) first.
        <br>
        <br>Desktop declined and mobile has skyrocketed (in use and sales), which means we now design for 
        <br>many, many screen types rather than just one- the average person has 2-3 devices now.
        <br>You have to be able to display resposively to all of them.
        <br>
        <br>Just because a site is responsive does not mean it was designed mobile first. 
        <br>There are more likely to be errors in design when you don't put mobile first, leading to less site traffic as users become frustrated.
        <br>
        <br>Even though a re-write is costly and time-consuming, the pros usually outweigh it in the long run.
        <br>A rewrite to put mobile first will lead to the best uesr experience across devices,
        <br>constraints being addressed (bandwidth, etc.), and help your site be ready for growth.
        <br>
        <br>People aren't on laptops/desktops 24/7, but people check their phones an average of 344 times a day.
        <br>Mobile isn't a fad- and neither are new devices. We have to make sure we're ready to include them.
