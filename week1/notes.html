    <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
    <p>
        Computers/applications aren't going to remember anything by themselves. You have to tell them.
        <br><br>
        IO = Input/Output
        <br><br>
        Section takes up the whole width of the page by default.
        <br><br>
        You can use 'localStorage' and it doesn't have to be created by you... kind of like 'document'.
        <br>It also has functions that come with it, such as 'getItem' and 'setItem'... a bit like document's getElementById or querySelector functions.
        <br>When using setItem, you have to pass in a key/value pair. This will be like in python when you add an item to a dictionary. 
        <br>You can access the value by using the key to find it.
        <br><br>
        When using input or textarea, use '.value', when using section, use '.innerHTML'.

        Questions- 
        <br>- It says the header tags only go through h4... Is that true? I thought it was h6.
        <br>- They didn't use labels for their input... but I did. It think it's better that way.
