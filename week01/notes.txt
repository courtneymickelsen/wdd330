Week 1 Notes

Reading:

Computers/applications aren't going to remember anything by themselves. You have to tell them.

IO = Input/Output

Section takes up the whole width of the page by default.

You can use 'localStorage' and it doesn't have to be created by you... kind of like 'document'.
It also has functions that come with it, such as 'getItem' and 'setItem'... a bit like document's getElementById or querySelector functions.
When using setItem, you have to pass in a key/value pair. This will be like in python when you add an item to a dictionary. 
You can access the value by using the key to find it.

When using input or textarea, use '.value', when using section, use '.innerHTML'.

Questions- 
- It says the header tags only go through h4... Is that true? I thought it was h6.
- They didn't use labels for their input... but I did. It think it's better that way?

Video:
    
Design for the smallest and least powerful device (that your software will be viewed on) first.

Desktop declined and mobile has skyrocketed (in use and sales), which means we now design for 
many, many screen types rather than just one- the average person has 2-3 devices now.
You have to be able to display resposively to all of them.

Just because a site is responsive does not mean it was designed mobile first. 
There are more likely to be errors in design when you don't put mobile first, leading to less site traffic as users become frustrated.

Even though a re-write is costly and time-consuming, the pros usually outweigh it in the long run.
A rewrite to put mobile first will lead to the best uesr experience across devices,
constraints being addressed (bandwidth, etc.), and help your site be ready for growth.

People aren't on laptops/desktops 24/7, but people check their phones an average of 344 times a day.
Mobile isn't a fad- and neither are new devices. We have to make sure we're ready to include them.
